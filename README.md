How to install: Download the project.You need to download the latest Facebook iOS SDK and add it to the project. Download it here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/. All the code to implement the Facebook SDK is already there.Next you need to sign up on http://pingpal.io/ for a free developer account. From your developer dashboard you can download the iOS BETA SDK witch you will need to add to the project just like you did with the Facebook SDK. All the code is already done.The last thing to do is to create an app on the developer dashboard. Name it whatever you want. Then you need to copy the apps App ID and Secret and paste them in the AppDelegate.m file in the project. #define PUBLIC_KEY @"App ID here"#define PRIVATE_KEY @"Secret here"And thats it.
